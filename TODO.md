# TODO

- Look into sending WebSocket traffic over wss instead of ws (not encrypted)
- Implement more subscription stuff

## Later

- Look into orderBy: last updated (Not working as expected for chat list query)
- Implement max size for usernames (An eventually names)
- Look into adding paging support to application server for:
  - chat messages
  - chats (that will be in sidebar)
  - users
- Look into graph-yoga file upload for profile pictures
- Use GraphQL Shield: https://github.com/maticzav/graphql-shield (If needed)
- Look into Apollo Engine for API usage reporting
- Look into sentry.io for error reporting
- Add now.json
- Look into setting up circleCI
